# Fight insomnia by counting sheeps ðŸ’¤

These pandemic days, I have trouble sleeping and a thought came to my mind: Why not to update the way we fight insomnia?

ðŸ˜‰ This project is a small CSS and React practice.

ðŸ“¢ Note: If you want to play with the sheeps, go to the styles of elements with class 'sheep' and change the animation to: <br>

#### animation: sheep-walking-cycle linear 20s infinite reverse;

<br>
You would see a sheep doing a moonwalkingðŸ’•.
